# Random Workout Selector

I want to create a random workout selector as I like doing the insanity workouts,
I feel that the schedule is too brutal so I have idea of creating a format where I can
select which type of workout.

## Type of workouts

So I am going to split these up into to four categories:

* Month 1 workouts
* Month 2 workouts
* Recovery workouts
* Gym

### Month 1 workouts

These will consist of workouts from insanity and insanity MAX:30 month 1.

### Month 2 workouts

These will consist of workouts from insanity and insanity MAX:30 month 2.

### Recovery workouts

These will consist of the recovery workout from insanity and insanity MAX:30 and also yoga and pilates from P90X.

### Gym

These will consist of gym workouts that I enjoy.

## Technology

The technology I will be using to create this is HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
